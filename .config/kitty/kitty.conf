#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

# font_family      monospace
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::


#: Font size (in pts)

# force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
#: ירושלים, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם
#: actually writes into the selection buffer the character י.  kitty's
#: default behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse
#: the word order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it
#: can be very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to
#: turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command
#: line program GNU FriBidi
#: <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable> to get BIDI
#: support, because it will force kitty to always treat the text as
#: LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

# adjust_line_height  0
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

# adjust_baseline 0

#: Adjust the vertical alignment of text (the height in the cell at
#: which text is positioned). You can use either numbers, which are
#: interpreted as pixels or a percentages (number followed by %),
#: which are interpreted as the percentage of the line height. A
#: positive value moves the baseline up, and a negative value moves
#: them down. The underline and strikethrough positions are adjusted
#: accordingly.

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them.  You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features setting.

# font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code Retina includes a discretionary
#: feature, zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the
#: zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code
#: Retina also includes other discretionary features known as
#: Stylistic Sets which have the tags ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: Harfbuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, these are read from the FontConfig database first and
#: then this, setting is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use kitty + list-fonts
#: --psnames:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty + list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: }}}
#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems
#: with client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, a value of background
#: means to use the background color of the currently active window
#: and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, a value of
#: background means to use the background color of the currently
#: active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
#: #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack, as
#: there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color
#: of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it
#: is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both,
#: you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
#: hide_window_decorations.

# macos_option_as_alt no

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique. You
#: can use the values: left, right, or both to use only the left,
#: right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Changing this setting by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (⌘+Tab) on macOS. Changing
#: this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS. Changing this setting by reloading the config
#: will only affect newly created windows.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes. For example, a value of
#: 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel
#: antialiasing at common font sizes.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but
#: less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Show or hide the window title in the macOS window or menu-bar. A
#: value of window will show the title of the currently active window
#: at the top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the
#: title of the currently active window in the macOS menu-bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. all will show the title everywhere
#: and none hides the title in the window and the menu-bar.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Enable/disable custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see
#: on both light and dark backgrounds. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this setting
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this setting by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase unicode characters.
#: For example: ``a`` for the A key, ``[`` for the left square bracket
#: key, etc. For functional keys, such as ``Enter or Escape`` the
#: names are present at https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-
#: protocol.html#functional-key-definitions. For a list of modifier
#: names, see: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option.
#: Then kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that
#: text look for ``native_code`` the value of that becomes the key
#: name in the shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 65 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: 0x0 text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map ctrl+a to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: You can create aliases for kitten names, this allows overriding the
#: defaults for kitten options and can also be used to shorten
#: repeated mappings of the same kitten with a specific group of
#: options. For example, the above alias changes the default value of
#: kitty +kitten hints --hints-offset to zero for all mappings,
#: including the builtin ones.

#: Clipboard {{{

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#: There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#: mapped to Ctrl+c. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#: send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly, copy_and_clear_or_interrupt
#: will copy and clear the selection or send an interrupt if there is
#: no selection.

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+s paste_from_selection
# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#: will be passed as a command line argument to the program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: }}}

#: Scrolling {{{

# map kitty_mod+up        scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+down      scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+page_up   scroll_page_up
# map kitty_mod+page_down scroll_page_down
# map kitty_mod+home      scroll_home
# map kitty_mod+end       scroll_end
# map kitty_mod+h         show_scrollback

#: You can pipe the contents of the current screen + history buffer as
#: STDIN to an arbitrary program using the ``launch`` function. For
#: example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in less in an
#: overlay window::

#:     map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#: For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#: programs, see launch.

#: }}}

#: Window management {{{

# map kitty_mod+enter new_window

#: You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+y      launch mutt

#: You can open a new window with the current working directory set to
#: the working directory of the current window using::

#:     map ctrl+alt+enter    launch --cwd=current

#: You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via the
#: kitty remote control facility by prefixing the command line with @.
#: Any programs running in that window will be allowed to control
#: kitty. For example::

#:     map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

#: You can open a new window next to the currently active window or as
#: the first window, with::

#:     map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor some_program
#:     map ctrl+f launch --location=first some_program

#: For more details, see launch.

# map kitty_mod+n new_os_window

#: Works like new_window above, except that it opens a top level OS
#: kitty window. In particular you can use new_os_window_with_cwd to
#: open a window with the current working directory.

# map kitty_mod+w close_window
# map kitty_mod+] next_window
# map kitty_mod+[ previous_window
# map kitty_mod+f move_window_forward
# map kitty_mod+b move_window_backward
# map kitty_mod+` move_window_to_top
# map kitty_mod+r start_resizing_window
# map kitty_mod+1 first_window
# map kitty_mod+2 second_window
# map kitty_mod+3 third_window
# map kitty_mod+4 fourth_window
# map kitty_mod+5 fifth_window
# map kitty_mod+6 sixth_window
# map kitty_mod+7 seventh_window
# map kitty_mod+8 eighth_window
# map kitty_mod+9 ninth_window
# map kitty_mod+0 tenth_window
#: }}}

#: Tab management {{{

# map kitty_mod+right next_tab
# map kitty_mod+left  previous_tab
# map kitty_mod+t     new_tab
# map kitty_mod+q     close_tab
# map shift+cmd+w     close_os_window
# map kitty_mod+.     move_tab_forward
# map kitty_mod+,     move_tab_backward
# map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title

#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab, 2 the second tab and -1 being the previously active
#: tab, and any number larger than the last tab being the last tab::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and use
#: new_tab_with_cwd. Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to
#: the current tab rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]
#: }}}

#: Layout management {{{

# map kitty_mod+l next_layout

#: You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific layouts::

#:     map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
#:     map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

#: Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout::

#:    map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout
#: }}}

#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at
#: a time or only the current one.

# map kitty_mod+equal     change_font_size all +2.0
# map kitty_mod+minus     change_font_size all -2.0
# map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size all 0

#: To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current OS window's font
#: size::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0
#: }}}

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

# map kitty_mod+e kitten hints

#: Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#: to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#: Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful, for
#: instance to run git commands on a filename output from a previous
#: git command.

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#: Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#: Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for the
#: output of things like: ls -1

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#: Select words and insert into terminal.

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#: Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#: terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#: commits

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#: Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#: vim at the specified line number.

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#: Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by the
#: terminal program, for example, by ls --hyperlink=auto).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.
#: }}}

#: Miscellaneous {{{

# map kitty_mod+f11    toggle_fullscreen
# map kitty_mod+f10    toggle_maximized
# map kitty_mod+u      kitten unicode_input
# map kitty_mod+f2     edit_config_file
# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

#: Open the kitty shell in a new window/tab/overlay/os_window to
#: control kitty using commands.

# map kitty_mod+a>m    set_background_opacity +0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>l    set_background_opacity -0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>1    set_background_opacity 1
# map kitty_mod+a>d    set_background_opacity default
#: You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For example::

#:     # Reset the terminal
#:     map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#:     # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#:     map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#:     # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#:     map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active
#:     # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#:     map kitty_mod+f12 clear_terminal scroll active

#: If you want to operate on all windows instead of just the current
#: one, use all instead of active.

#: It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#: screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#: instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#: following to ~/.zshrc:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#:         printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#:         zle clear-screen
#:     }
#:     zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#:     bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file

#: Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it was
#: loaded. Note that a handful of settings cannot be dynamically
#: changed and require a full restart of kitty.  You can also map a
#: keybinding to load a different config file, for example::

#:     map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#: Note that all setting from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#: in other words the new conf settings *replace* the old ones.

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config

#: Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running with
#: and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.


#: You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#: client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#: This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#: combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so you
#: can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send
#: unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode characters
#: directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to send_text is the
#: keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
#: values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated
#: combination of them.  The special keyword all means all modes. The
#: modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#: for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty extended
#: keyboard protocol.

#: Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#: the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
